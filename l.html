<h1><font size="30">Lamoni Iowa</font></h1>
<h5> Lamoni Iowa is located in the very tip of Iowa close to the boarder of Missouri. Lamoni Iowa was established in 1866. Lamoni has different home owned restarants like the amish store, the coffee shop, mexican restarant and the pizza shack. these locations are originated in lamoni and its their pride locations. Lamoni has amazing people who are very welcoming and gather together for important events. Even though lamoni doesnt have big stores like walmart and target they still manage to have stores like hyvee and dollar general.
